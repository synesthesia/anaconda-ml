This repository contains my working notes from following the Anaconda training module [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://learning.anaconda.cloud/getting-started-with-ai-ml),
and starts with material from the [course repository](https://github.com/thomasnield/anaconda_intro_to_machine_learning/tree/main), augmented with further personal notes / experiments.
